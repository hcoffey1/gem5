# access pattern: A, B, C, D, A, B, E, F, G, H, C, D, C, D
# Each letter represents a 128-bit address range.
# If you have a 512B cache using LRU as the replacement policy
# with 4-way associativity, and each cache line is 64B. You will observe:
# m, m, m, m, h, h, m, m, m, m, m, m, h, h, where 'h' means hit and 'm'
# means miss.
# Explanation of this result:
# A,B,C,D are misses, now the cache stores (A*,B,C,D) and A marked as the
# LRU.
# A,B are hits, and the cache stores (A,B,C*,D)
# E searches for a victim and selects C. Now the cache stores (A,B,E,D*).
# F searches for a victim and selects D. Now the cache stores (A*,B,E,F).
# G searches for a victim and selects A. Now the cache stores (G,B*,E,F).
# H searches for a victim and selects B. Now the cache stores (G,H,E*,F).
# C searches for a victim and selects E. Now the cache stores (G,H,C,F*).
# D searches for a victim and selects F. Now the cache stores (G*,H,C,D).
# C,D are hits.

# state 0: access from A to D
# state 1: access A and B
# state 2: access from E to H
# state 3: access C and D
# state 4: access C and D
