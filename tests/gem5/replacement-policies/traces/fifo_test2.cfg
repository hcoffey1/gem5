# access pattern: A, B, C, D, A, B, E, F, C, D
# If you have a 512B cache with 4-way associativity, and each cache
# line is 64B, with FIFO replacement policy, you will observe:
# m, m, m, m, h, h, m, m, h, h, where 'm' means miss, and 'h' means hit.
# Explanation of this result:
# A,B,C,D are misses, now the cache stores (A*,B,C,D) and A marked as the head
# of the queue.
# A,B are hits, and the cache stores (A*,B,C,D)
# E searches for a victim and selects A. Now the cache stores (E,B*,C,D).
# F searches for a victim and selects B. Now the cache stores (E,F,C*,D).
# C and D are hits.

# state 0: access from A to D
# state 1: access A and B
# state 2: access E and F
# state 3: access C and D
