# access pattern: A, B, C, D, A, E, F, G, B, A
# Each letter represents a 128-bit address range.
# If you have a 512B cache with 4-way associativity, and each cache
# line is 64B. This test can be used to test the correctness of RRIP
# replacement policy. The value of hit_priority will decide whether to
# evict block 'A' or not even if you insert multiple (4) accesses after
# 'A' hits. More specifically, with RRIP replacement policy(num_bits = 2,
#  hit_priority = true), you will observe: m, m, m, m, h, m, m, m, m, h,
# where 'm' means miss, and 'h' means hit. However, with the same cache
# and policy, if you set hit_priority = false (num_bits = 2), you will observe:
# m, m, m, m, h, m, m, m, m, m.
# Explanation of this result:
# A,B,C,D are misses, now the cache stores (A2,B2,C2,D2). The number following
# each letter is the RRPV for that address range.
# A is a hit, now the cache stores (A1,B2,C2,D2)
# E searches for a victim and selects the highest RRPV, B. Since B is not
# saturated, all other counters are increased by the difference of B to
# saturation: 1 (A2,E2,C3,D3).
# F searches for a victim and selects C. Now the cache stores (A2,E2,F2,D3).
# G searches for a victim and selects D. Now the cache stores (A2,E2,F2,G2).
# B searches for a victim and selects the highest RRPV, A. Now the cache stores
# (B2,E3,F3,G3).
# A searches for a victim and selects the highest RRPV, E. Now the cache stores
# (B2,A2,F3,G3).
