# access pattern: A, B, C, D, A, E, A, C, F, C, D
# Each letter represents a 128-bit address range.
# If you have a 512B cache with 4-way associativity, and each cache
# line is 64B. This test can be used to test the correctness of NRU
# replacement policy. The NRU replacement policy will always find
# the victim block from the left side of a cache. More specifically,
# with NRU replacement policy, you will observe:
# m, m, m, m, h, m, m, h, m, h, m, where 'm' means miss, and 'h' means
# hit.
# Explanation of this result:
# A,B,C,D are misses, now the cache stores (A0,B0,C0,D0). The number
# following each letter is the NRU bit for the address range.
# A is a hit. Now the cache stores (A0,B0,C0,D0).
# E searches a victim and selects A. Now the cache stores (E0,B1,C1,D1).
# A searches a victim and selects E. Now the cache stores (E0,A0,C1,D1).
# C is a hit. Now the cache stores (E0,A0,C0,D1).
# F searchs a victim and selects D. Now the cache stores (E0,A0,C0,F0).
# C is a hit. Now the cache stores (E0,A0,C0,F0).
# D searches a victim and selects E. Now the cache stores (D0,A1,C1,F1).
