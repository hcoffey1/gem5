# access pattern: A, B, C, D, A, E, F, G, H, A, D
# Each letter represents a 128-bit address range.
# If you have a 512B cache using MRU as the replacement policy
# with 4-way associativity, and each cache line is 64B. You will observe:
# m, m, m, m, h, m, m, m, m, m, h where 'h' means hit and 'm' means miss.
# Explanation of this result:
# A,B,C,D are misses, now the cache stores (A,B,C,D*). D is marked as
#  the MRU.
# A is a hit, now the cache stores (A*,B,C,D).
# E searches for a victim and selects A. Now the cache stores (E*,B,C,D).
# F searches for a victim and selects E. Now the cache stores (F*,B,C,D).
# G searches for a victim and selects F. Now the cache stores (G*,B,E,D).
# H searches for a victim and selects G. Now the cache stores (H*.B,E,D).
# A searches for a victim and selects H. Now the cache stores (A*,B,C,D).
# D is a hit.

# state 0: access from A to D
# state 1: access A
# state 2: access from E to H
# state 3: access A
# state 4: access D
