# access pattern: A, B, C, D, A, E, F, G, H, A
# Each letter represents a 128-bit address range.
# If you have a 512B cache with 4-way associativity, and each cache
# line is 64B, with LFU replacement policy, you will observe:
# m, m, m, m, h, m, m, m, m, h  where 'm' means miss, and 'h' means
# hit.
# Explanation of this result:
# A,B,C,D are misses, now the cache stores (A1,B1,C1,D1). The number
# follwing each letter is the count for the accesses of each letter.
# A is a hit, and the cache now stores (A2,B1,C1,D1).
# E searches a victim and selects B. Now the cache stores (A2,E1,C1,D1).
# F searches a victim and selects E. Now the cache stores (A2,F1,C1,D1).
# G searches a victim and selects F. Now the cache stores (A2,G1,C1,D1).
# H searches a victim and selects G. Now the cache stores (A2,H1,C1,D1).
# A hits.
