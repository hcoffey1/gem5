# access pattern: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, A, B
# Each letter represents a 128-bit address range.
# If you have a 512B cache using MRU as the replacement policy
# with 4-way associativity, and each cache line is 64B. You will observe:
# m, m, m, m, m, m, m, m, h, h, where 'h' means hit and 'm' means miss.
# Explanation of this result:
# A,B,C,D are misses, now the cache stores (A,B,C,D*). D is marked as
# the MRU.
# E searches for a victim and selects D. Now the cache stores (A,B,C,E*).
# F searches for a victim and selects E. Now the cache stores (A,B,C,F*).
# G searches for a victim and selects F. Now the cache stores (A,B,E,G*).
# H searches for a victim and selects G. Now the cache stores (A.B,E,H*).
# A,B are hits.

# state 0: access from A to D
# state 1: access from E to H
# state 2: access A and B
