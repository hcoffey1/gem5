# access pattern: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, A, B, C, D, A, E, B
# Each letter represents a 128-bit address range. For example, A represents
# If you have a 512B cache using LIP as the replacement policy
# with 4-way associativity, and each cache line is 64B, you will observe:
# m,m,m,m,m,m,m,m,m,h,h,h,h,m,m
# where 'h' means hit and 'm' means miss.
# Explanation of this result:
# A,B,C,D are misses, now the cache stores (A,B,C,D)
# E searches for a victim and selects A. Now the cache stores (E,B,C,D).
# F searches for a victim and selects E. Now the cache stores (F,B,C,D).
# G searches for a victim and selects F. Now the cache stores (G,B,C,D).
# H searches for a victim and selects G. Now the cache stores (H,B,C,D).
# A searches for a victim and selects H. Now the cache stores (A,B,C,D).
# B,C,D are hits.
# E searches for a victim and selects B. Now the cache stores (A,E,C,D).
# B is a miss.

# state 0: access from A to D
