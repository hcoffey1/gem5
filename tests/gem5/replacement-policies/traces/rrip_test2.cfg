# access pattern: A, A, A, B, B, C, C, D, E, F, G, H, A
# Each letter represents a 128-bit address range.
# For example, if you have a 512B cache with 4-way associativity, and
# each cache line is 64B. This test can be used to test the correctness
# of RRIP replacement policy. More specifically, with RRIP replacement
# policy(num_bits = 2, hit_priority = false), you will observe:
# m, h, h, m, h, m, h, m, m, m, m, m, h
# where 'm' means miss, and 'h' means hit.
# Explanation of this result:
# After three A access, two B accesses, 2 c accesses and one D access,
# the cache stores (A0,B1,C1,D2). The number following each letter is
# the RRPV for that address range.
# E searches a victim and selects D. Now the cache stores (A1,B2,C2,E2).
# F searches a victim and selects B. Now the cache stores (A2,F2,C3,E3).
# G searches a victim and selects C. Now the cache stores (A2,F2,G2,E3).
# H searches a victim and selects E. NOW the cache stores (A2,F2,G2,H2)
# A is a hit.

# state 0, 1, 2: access A for three times
# state 3, 4: access B for two times
# state 5, 6: access C for two times
# state 7: access from D to H
# state 8: access A
