# If you have a 512B cache with 4-way associativity, and each cache
# line is 64B, with LFU replacement policy, you will observe:
# m, m, m, m, h, h, h, h, h, h, h, h, m, m, h, h, h, m, m, h, h, h, m,
# m, h, h, h, m, m, where 'm' means miss, and 'h' means hit.
# Explanation of this result:
# After two A accesses, three B accesses, one C access and two D accesses,
# the cache stores (A2,B3,C1,D2). The numbers after each letter are the
# counts of accesses to that address range.
# E searches a victim and selects C. Now the cache stores (A2,B3,E1,D2).
# C searches a victim and selects E. Now the cache stores (A2,B3,C1,D2).
# Three C accesses are hits. Now the cache stores (A2,B3,C4,D2).
# F searches a victim and selects A. Now the cache stores (F1,B3,C4,D2).
# A searches a victim and selects F. Now the cache stores (A1,B3,C4,D2).
# Three A accesses are hits. Now the cache stores (A4,B3,C4,D2).
# G searches a victim and selects D. Now the cache stores (A4,B3,C4,G1).
# D searches a victim and selects G. Now the cache stores (A4,B3,C4,D1).
# Three D accesses are hits. Now the cache stores (A4,B3,C4,D4).
# H searches a victim and selects B. Now the cache stores (A4,H1,C4,D4).
# B is a miss.
